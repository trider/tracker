##Maps of Love  
Welcome to the Maps of Love project a cross-platform, maps application for mobile phones and tablets.
The app is named after the ALYN Hospital's Wheels of Love International Bike Ride.  The ride raises funds for 
the ALYN Pediatric and Adolescent Rehabilitation Center, in Jerusalem Israel. As both a participant in the ride 
and as a cross-platform, mobile application developer, I wanted to use my skills 
to publicize the ride, fundraise, and help other riders. I also wanted to create something that others could use 
as the basis for their own applications. For more information, see the [Maps of Love Project Page](http://projectpage.mapsoflove.net).

**The Maps of Love is not an official Wheels of Love Application. The Alyn Hospital and the Wheels of Love Ride are not in involved with this project.**

###Maps of Love App
The app is designed to provide maps and information regarding each days ride. The apps launch screen lets you choose a ride, (Off-road, On-road, etc.), the day's ride (Day 1 to 5), 
and display the ride's elevation (optional).  After you selected  a ride, the app displays a map of the ride. In addition, it also lets you locate your current position, track your ride, 
and display you a text description.

The app is created with cross-platform web technologies including, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. All project code was pushed 
to this GitHub repository.
