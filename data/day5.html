    <p>5 day riders - From Nachsholim we will be transported by bus to Mini Israel (a theme park - Israel in miniature) from where the day's ride begins!</p>
    <p>We begin our ascent up to Jerusalem along the "Burma Road" which was paved in 1948 as a makeshift bypass road between the area surrounding
       Kibbutz Hulda and Jerusalem. Riding through the pine forests planted by Keren Kayemet LeYisrael and through natural Mediterranean thicket we will 
       begin our climb up to the Judean Hills and Jerusalem Mountains. We will cross the Carmila Ravine and climb up to Mt. 
       Carmila where there is a wonderful lookout point! After riding along the winding Kisalon Gorge we will descend into the gorge and climb back up to Mish Hill.</p>
    <p>After riding through Wadi Tayasim we will ascend Tel Tzuba (archeological hill) and continue through the orchards of Kibbutz Tzuba until we reach 
       the Sataf Springs. We will ride through Mt. Eitan and descent into the Sorek Ravine. At the Kerem Junction we will join the On-road WOL 
       riders for the last part of the Ride! ALYN Hospital is just a short climb away! </p>
