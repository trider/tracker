        <title>Off-road: Day 2</title>
    </head>
<body>
<p>Today we will encircle the beautiful evergreen Carmel Mountain. We head north from the Dor Beach, riding through the most beautiful coastal nature reserve in Israel Dor-HaBonim, in which the wind and waves sculptured rocky inlets and hidden lagoons. Nearby Kibbutz Ein Carmel we turn east, and cross road no. 4 into the western slopes of Mount Carmel, entering the prehistoric human site of Nahal HaMe'arot. Four caves where discovered on the southern bank of the Nahal HaMe'arot, containing evidence of over one million years of human activity, a rare phenomenon anywhere in the world. Last year this site was proclaimed as universal value by UNESCO, and attracts many visitors.</p> 

<p>We will ride through the beautiful dry river bed, and as we begin the incline, we will split into two riding groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular Off-road riders will climb up to the Druze village, Daliat El-Carmel, and ride through the picturesque village roads, and the famous market, to the Horn of the Carmel, known as the "Muhraka" site.</li>
<li>Enduro riders will ride up to a beautiful outlook at Mount Shokef, 1,600 ft., slide to the Alon Valley, and climb again to the highest point of the Carmel ridge, at an altitude of 1,800 ft.  From this point we will ride along the northern cliff of the Carmel, to the Carmel Horn, overlooking the striking view of the Jezreel Valley.</li>
</ul>
<p>All Off-road riders will meet up again at the Muhraka, next to the statue of the prophet Elijah in the courtyard of the Monastery of the Carmelite Order. On this summit the dramatic battle between Elijah and the prophets of Baal took place. The fire and rain from the sky fell in this exact location and marked Elijah's triumph.</p>
<p>We now begin our ride westwards to Mt. Somek and Kerem Maharal, through the marvelous olive groves of the Makura ranch, based in the heart of an ancient volcano. We cross road no. 4 again back towards the coast, along the HaBonim-Dor Reserve, and return to the Dor Beach.
