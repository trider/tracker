<body>
    <p>We will leave Kibbutz Beit Alpha and ride at the foothills of Mt. Gilboa's eastern cliff.  As we reach the Nachal Bezek Reserve we begin our steep incline to the 1,650 ft. peak of Mt. Avner. The Gilboa's scenic 18-kilometer-long mountainous ridge is an outcome of a tectonic shift along the Syrian-African Rift Valley.</p>  
    <p>The famous battle of King Saul against the Philistines took place here. The battle ends with the king falling on his own sword, with Jonathan and two other  sons of King Saul killed in battle, followed by David's lamentation: (Samuel II 1:21) “Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you”.</p>
    <p>We will ride from Mt. Avner, to Malkishua (named after one of King Saul's sons), appreciating the views of the Spring Valley, laying peacefully beneath us. Next to Kibbutz Ma'aleh Gilboa we will again split into two riding groups according to the technical level of the rider and the length of the trail. Both groups will enjoy different parts of the new Gilboa single track, planned and built by our very own Hovav Landau, a veteran Wheels of Love rider, in alliance with the JNF and the Gilboa Regional Council.</p>
    <p>The trails will take us along the northern Gilboa ridge, overlooking the Jezreel Valley, and downhill to Gan-Ner, close to the artificial ski resort built here a few years ago, but now no longer in use.</p> </body>
