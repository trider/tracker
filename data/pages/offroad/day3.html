<p>Today we bid farewell to the Mediterranean Coast, and begin our ride inland. From Dor we ride through Moshav  Ein Ayala, cross road no. 4 yet again and climb Nachal Shimri, at the southern slopes of the Carmel. We continue to Bat Shlomo, and ride through this agricultural colony which was founded in 1889 with the support of Baron Rothschild.</p>
<p>We cross road no. 70 to the Mt. Horshan and Alona parks, enjoying the impressive oak trees, and ride in Nahal Taninim, (the crocodiles….) which we remember from Sunday. Today we ride through the upper part of this river bed, full of natural springs and water vegetation. The Ramot Menashe Park, which we are riding through, is known by some as the “Tuscany of the Middle East". In 2011 UNESCO recognized its 20,000 acres as a biosphere for preservation, in order to maintain the natural and rural characteristics of this area.</p>
<p>We continue eastwards through the Megiddo forest, and Nachal  Kaynie, and cross road no. 65 towards Kibbutz Givat Oz, passing the famous archeological site of Tel Megiddo.             Did you know that the word "Armageddon", described in the New Testament as the apocalypse, derives from the Hebrew "Har Megiddo" meaning "Mount of Megiddo"…? However, we focus on the living, and there is nothing more vibrant than the fertile agriculture fields of the Jezreel Valley, through which we ride till we arrive Nachal Harod.</p>  
<p>The refreshing Ein Jezreel Spring will be the last site of today's ride, from which point regular Off-road riders will head to the nearby Ma’ayan Harod Guest House, and the Enduro group will continue five more miles (8 km) to the Beit Alpha Guest House. Both groups are staying at the foot of Mt. Gilboa. Looking up to this beautiful ridge we see our next day's destination.</p>
