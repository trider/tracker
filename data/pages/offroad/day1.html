        <title>Off-road: Day 1</title>

<body>
<p>We will gather at the Mevo'ot Yam Harbor in Michmoret for the festive Opening Ceremony of the 14th Wheels of Love Ride! From Michmoret, we head south to Nachal places in Israel in which the unique soft-shelled turtles can be observed. In 1991, the Israel Nature & National Parks Authority launched a preservation project to protect the endangered turtles' population following serious flooding of the stream.</p>
<p>We will ride eastwards upstream and continue in a northerly direction through Emek Hefer's groves and orchards until we reach the Ma'anit Forest. This is a 4,500 acre Nature Reserve of old oak trees and rich vegetation and wildlife. In recent years numerous bike trails were opened in the forest, which is very popular amongst "off-roaders". Here we will split to two groups based on your challenge level! Enduro riders will enjoy technical riding, and the regular Off-road riders can appreciate the "calmer" trails in this beautiful woodland.</p>
<p>From Ma'anit Forest we will continue north through the Nadiv Valley, on our way back to the Mediterranean. This fertile plain between Binyamina and Givat Ada was completely covered with swamps up to the 1930's and the big eucalyptus trees, brought from Australia, are the living proof of the success of the draining projects.</p>
<p>We will cross Nachal Taninim, the Crocodile Stream, on our way to Kibbutz Ma'agan Michael. Crocodilesâ€¦? Hard to believe, however 19th century travelers testify that crocodiles were common in this area. The last time a crocodile was spotted here was in 1912. We will ride past the springs of the Taninim Nature Reserve, and continue alongside the Ma'agan Michael fishponds, situated along the Carmel shore. As we follow a bird migrating route, this is a popular bird-watching site and the ponds are full of activity of various species of birds. North of Ma'agan Michael is the magnificent Dor beach where we end our first day of the Ride.</p>
