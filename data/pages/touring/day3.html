<p>Leave Tiberias, and ride past Kibbutz Ginosar, Migdal and Capernaum, sites from the Second Temple period, known to us from the New Testament.  Continue to the Yehudia Junction leading to the eastern side of the lake. Continue south to Kibbutz Ein Gev and Kibbutz Ha'on, then turn off to the beautiful site of Hamat Gader, an active spa and archaeological site of the second-largest bath complex in the entire Roman Empire. </p>
<p>Enjoy lunch and the natural spa.  You can also tour one of the largest crocodile farms in the Middle East. Ascend the Golan Heights to the Mitzpe Shalom observation point. Our return route takes us past Kibbutz Kinneret, and the renowned Kinneret Cemetery, where legendary icons such as Rachel the Poetess and Naomi Shemer are buried.</p>
