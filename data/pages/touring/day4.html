<body>
<p>Bid farewell to Tiberias as we ride through the city's streets up to a marvelous road overlooking the dramatic vistas of the lake and its surroundings. Ride through “The Switzerland Forest”, to the Poriya Youth Hostel, and down for another quick and steep descent back to the lake. Continue along the shores of the Kinneret back to the Zemach Junction, then south for about 18 miles through the beautiful Jordan River Valley to Beit She'an.  On our way we pass the historic Naharayim hydroelectric power-plant located on the Jordan River.</p>
<p>We stop cycling here and visit the impressive archeological site from the Roman and Byzantine periods: the amphitheater, the pillars of the cardo, (the city's main road), and the magnificently preserved bath house. Continue by bus to the summit of Mt. Gilboa, the site of King Saul's famous battle against the Philistines, a battle that ended tragically with the king falling on his own sword and his son Jonathan being killed in battle. Enjoy the striking view of the Jezre'el Valley.  Time permitting, join the On-Road riders for the beautiful ride down from the summit down to Gan-Ner, close to the artificial ski resort built here a few years ago, but no longer active.</p> </body>
