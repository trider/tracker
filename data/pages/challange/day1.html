<p>We will gather at the Mevo'ot Yam Harbor in Michmoret for the festive Opening Ceremony of the 14th Wheels of Love Ride!      From Michmoret, we head south to Beit Yanai, crossing Nachal Alexander's estuary to the Mediterranean. We then take one       last glimpse at the coastal area, and ride eastwards through Moshav Kfar Vitkin to road no. 4, the old coastal road.</p>
    <p>During the first part of the day we will ride through the beautiful groves and orchards of the Emek Hefer Regional Council, established in 1940, and the first Regional Council to be recognized by the British Mandate. We will ride past the Ruppin Academic Center and continue southwards to Kfar Yona. On road 57, we will go eastwards, and from this point onwards, we will ride north for the rest of the day. We will pass Kibbutz Yad Hannah, named after  Hannah Senesh,  one of the 37 Jews who parachuted into Yugoslavia during World War II, and continue to Bat Hefer, on the east side of Highway 6, the Cross Israel Highway. Bat Hefer, located on the Shechem River, suffered a major flood this past winter when the river overflowed its banks. </p>
    <p>Continuing northwards  through the Menashe Regional Council, we will ride through Pardes Hanna, a town established in 1929, named after yet another Hannah, Hannah Rothschild, from the famous de Rothschild family.</p>
    <p>Close to Binyamina we will split for an additional 14 mile circuit, passing Givat Nili, Amikam and Aviel of the Alona Regional Council, the only three settlements of the smallest Regional Council in Israel. </p>
    <p>We will climb up to Zichron Yaakov passing Ramat Ha'Nadiv Park, the beautiful gardens and crypt in memory of Baron and Baroness de Rothschild. From Zichron we will descend towards the Mediterranean coast and end our first day at the beautiful Nachsholim Beach.</p>
