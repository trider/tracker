<p>We will begin our Ride southwards, climbing up on Road 90, towards Rosh Pina and the Amiad Junction.  From there we will descent to Korazim and Almagor near to the Jordan River estuary which flows into the Sea of Galilee. At this point we will turn left and encircle the lake, along its eastern side, until we reach the Zemach Beach which is at the southernmost point of the lake. </p>
    <p>The Kinneret, which is the lowest sweet-water lake in the world, supplies 25% of the water used in Israel. The level of the water in the Kinneret reflects the "national state of mind"  and this year, fortunately, the water level is the highest it has been for 10 years!!</p>
    <p>From Zemach we will head south to Beit Shean and back on Road 90 through the beautiful Jordan Valley settlements. On our way we will pass the Naharayim hydroelectric power-plant located  on the Jordan River. Established in Palestine in 1930 by Pinchas Rutenberg, the plant produced most of the energy which was consumed during the period of the British Mandate up until Israel's War of Independence in 1948.</p>
    <p>We will continue through the town of Beit She'an and the adjacent archeological site from  the Roman period which includes a beautiful amphitheater, impressive pillars of the Cardo - the city's main road and the bath house which has been magnificently preserved.     </p>
    <p>From Beit She'an we will ride through the fertile Spring Valley which many riders will remember from the first day of the 2011 WOL Ride. However this time we are heading in a different direction! We will ride close to the Gilboa Mountain range and then we will climb a steep and winding road up to Kibbutz Ma'ale Gilboa. </p>
    <p>After riding along the northern Gilboa ridge which overlooks the Jezreel Valley we will descend to Gan-Ner which is close to an artificial ski resort, built a few years ago but which is now no longer in use. </p>
