<p>We will leave the Nachsholim Resort and head northeastwards through the Lower Galilee up to the Hula Valley. </p>
<p>First we will ascent on Road no. 70 to the Elyakim Junction. From here we will turn right for a 10 mile ride through the Ramot Menashe Park, sometimes called the â€œTuscany of the Middle East"! In 2011 UNESCO recognized the 20,000 acres of the Ramot Menashe district as a biosphere for conservation in order to maintain the natural and rural characteristics of this area.</p>
    <p>From Kibbutz Mishmar Ha'Emek we will turn right again towards Megiddo Junction, passing the famous archeological site of Tel Megiddo. Did you know that the word "Armageddon", described in the New Testament as the apocalypse, derives from the Hebrew "Har Megiddo" meaning "Mount of Megiddo"?</p>
    <p>At the Megiddo Junction we will turn left on Road 65 and ride along the well-known "Ruler Road", crossing the fertile fields of the Jezreel Valley and riding through the town of Afula, the Capital of the Valley. We will be rewarded with an amazing view of Mt. Tabor rising 1,300 ft. above the valley floor with the Church of the Transfiguration on the top of the mount. </p>
    <p>We will continue to the Golani Junction where there is a museum commemorating the soldiers of the Golani Infantry Brigade. Heading northwards on Road 65, the scenery around us changes from the Lower Galilee hills to the Upper Galilee Mountains which will now be facing us. We descend towards Nahal Amud, the main dry river bed which drains Mt. Meron and the Tzfat region and flows down towards the Sea of Galilee (the Kinneret). We then ascent to the Ami'ad Junction and continue north on Road 90 all the way to Yesod HaMa'alah, established in built in 1882 as the first modern Jewish community in the Hula Valley. </p>
