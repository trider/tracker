    <p>We will leave Yesod Hama'ala and ride southwards on Road 90, turning towards Kibbutz Gadot.  Then we will descend towards the Jordan River and cross to the eastern bank. From this point we will begin our ascent up the basalt slopes of the Golan Heights. At the Wassat Junction we will head north towards the Odem Forest, riding amongst the (dormant) volcanic hills of which there are many in this area. </p>
    <p>We will ride through the Druze village of Majdal Shams which, at an altitude of 4,000 ft. is the highest settlement in Israel. From Majdal Shams we will take the road up to the Hermon, the highest mountain in Israel and as we make the ascent we will feel the temperature dropping!   We will certainly not reach the peak of the Hermon at 7,300 ft. but will climb as high as the weather and the security authorities permit! During the short winter ski season up to 12,000 visitors per day head towards the Hermon ski resort and during the rest of the year the ski slopes become popular down-hill biking trails! </p>
    <p>After a refreshing rest we will bid farewell to Mt. Hermon and descend back to Majdal Shams and then to the Banias Spring, passing Kala'at Nimrod, an impressive Crusader Fortress which we will see on the hill above us. Back in the Hula Valley we will be riding on lovely side roads until we connect back to Road 90 and to the Yesod Hama'ala junction where we will be ending this rewarding day's Ride.</p>
