        <p>We will be transported by bus to the Mini Israel site nearby the Latrun Junction, and begin here our final and day of the 14th Wheels of Love Ride. </p>
        <p>We will ride on two edges of the "triangle"- a popular route for bike riders from the area, alongside the Ayalon Valley, famous for one of Joshua's battles in which he called upon the sun to stop its progression in the sky until the battle was over. From Mishmar Ayalon we will continue through the vineyards nearby Karmei Yosef to the curving "Bravery Road". The road links two junctions which are named after the two heroes: Nachson and Shimshon. This part of the Road was paved during the War of Independence as a bypass to the road from Latrun to Sha'ar Hagai which was controlled by the Jordan Legion and blocked the way to Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>From the Shimshon Junction, we will continue to Eshtaol and it is here where we will start the significant climb for today.</p>
        <p>We will ride up through the pine forests planted by the JNF and through a natural Mediterranean thicket, on scenic roads all the way up to Ramat Raziel. We will then pass Tel Tsuba and the Sataf Springs, and descend to the Sorek Ravine. </p>
        <p>At the foot of the picturesque village of Ein Karem we will join all WOL riders for the last section of the Ride!  Hang in there â€“ the ALYN Hospital is just "around the corner!"</p>
        <p>From the Kerem Junction we will begin our final climb up through Ein Karem, to the Kiryat Hayovel Neighborhood and ride down to the ALYN Hospital where the children of ALYN will be waiting for us!!  </p>
