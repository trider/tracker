        <p>We will gather at the Mevo'ot Yam Harbor in Michmoret for the festive Opening Ceremony of the 14th Wheels of Love Ride! From Michmoret, 
           we head south to Beit Yanai, crossing Nachal Alexander's estuary to the Mediterranean. We then take one last glimpse at the coastal area, 
           and ride eastwards through Moshav Kfar Vitkin to road no. 4, the old coastal road.</p>
        <p>During the first part of the day we will ride through the beautiful groves and orchards of the Emek Hefer Regional Council, established in 1940, 
           and the first Regional Council to be recognized by the British Mandate. We will ride past the Ruppin Academic Center and continue southwards to 
           Kfar Yona. On road 57, we will go eastwards, and from this point onwards, we will ride north for the rest of the day. We will pass Kibbutz Yad Hannah,
           named after  Hannah Senesh on of the 37 Jews who parachuted during World War II into Yugoslavia, and continues to Bat Hefer, on the east side of Highway 6, 
           the Cross Israel Highway. Bat Hefer, located on the Shechem River, suffered a major flood this past winter as the river overflowed its banks.</p>
        <p>Continuing northwards  through the Menashe Regional Council, we will ride through Pardes Hanna, a town established in 1929, 
            named after yet another Hannah, Hannah Rothschild, from the famous Rothschild family.</p>
        <p>Close to Binyamina, we will split for an additional 14 mile circuit, passing Givat Nili, Amikam and Aviel of the Alona Regional Council, 
           the only three settlements of the smallest Regional Council in Israel. </p>
        <p>We will end the day climbing up to Zichron Yaakov founded by pioneers in 1882, passing Ramat Ha'Nadiv Park, with the beautiful memorial gardens 
           surrounding the crypt of the Baron and Baroness Rothschild.</p>
