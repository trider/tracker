        <p>Today we encircle the Sea of Galilee, the lowest sweet-water lake in the world, supplying 25% of the water use in Israel. 
           The water level measure of the Kinneret reflects the "national state of mind", and this year, fortunately, the water level is 
           the highest it has been in 10 yearsâ€¦!</p>
        <p>We leave Tiberias, and ride past Kibbutz Genosar, Migdal and Capernaum, the archeological fishermen village of the second temple period, 
           which was the center of Jesus's activity in the Galilee. At the northern edge of the lake we will cross the Jordan River flowing into the 
           Kinneret, and will continue to the Yahudiya Junction. From this point we will begin riding south on the eastern side of the lake. </p>
        <p>A great initiative of the Society of the Protection of Nature in Israel established the 'Around Kinneret Trail', for the use of 
           pedestrians and bike riders around the lake. As part of this process, fences were removed from supposedly private beaches in order 
           to enable free access to all the beaches. </p>
        <p>After passing the Kibbutzim Ein Gev and Ha'on, we will ride up to a beautiful outlook at Hamat Gader, the famous hot 
           springs site, known to be the second-largest bath complex in the entire Roman Empire.  Here is located one of the largest 
           crocodile farms in the Middle East with approximately 200 crocs of various species brought from the USA, South America and Africa.</p>
        <p>We will ride down back from Hamat Gader to the Sea of Galilee, and ride to the lake's southern point of Zemach. On our way back to Tiberias 
           we will ride past Kibbutz Kinneret, and the renowned Kinneret Cemetery. Rachel, the poetess who was buried here in 1931, wrote so many of 
           her songs inspired by the Kinneret scenery through which we are riding today. Naomi Shemer from Kvutzat Kinneret, a leading musician and
           songwriter ("Yerushalayim shel Zahav") was buried here nine years ago.</p>
