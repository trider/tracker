        <p>We will bid farewell to Tiberias as we ride strenuously up from the hotel through the city's streets on to a new and marvelous road 
           overlooking the amazing vista of the lake and its surroundings. This road will take us through the Switzerland Forest, to the 
           Poriya Youth Hostel, and down for another quick and steep decline back to the lake. We will again ride along the shore of the 
           Kinneret back to Zemach, and then south on road no. 90 for about 18 miles through the beautiful Jordan Valley settlements 
           until we reach Beit She'an. On our way we will pass the Naharayim hydroelectric power-plant located on the Jordan River. 
           Established in 1930 by Pinchas Rutenberg, the plant produced much of the energy consumed in the period of the 
           British Mandate of Palestine until Israel's War of Independence in 1948.</p>
        <p>We continue through the town of Beit She'an, close by the archeological remains of the Roman period 
           which comprise of the beautiful amphitheater, the impressive pillars of the cardo, the city's
           main road, and the bath house that was magnificently preserved.</p>
        <p>From Beit She'an we will ride through the fertile Spring Valley, which many riders may remember from the
           first day of the 2011 WOL Ride. This time we are heading in a different direction, getting close to the Gilboa
           mountain range and climbing on the curvy steep road going up to kibbutz Ma'ale Gilboa. </p>
        <p>The famous battle of King Saul against the Philistines took place on Mount Gilboa. The battle ends with the king
           falling on his own sword and Jonathan being killed in battle, followed by David's lamentation: (Samuel II 1:21) 
           “Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you”. </p>
        <p>We will ride along the northern Gilboa ridge, overlooking the Jezreel Valley, and downhill to Gan-Ner,
           close to the artificial ski resort built here a few years ago, but now no longer active. </p>
