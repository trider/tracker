        <p>We will be transported by bus to the Mini Israel site nearby the Latrun Junction, and begin here our final day of the 14th Wheels of Love Ride.</p>
        <p>From Mini Israel, we will cycle towards the Latrun Monastery, which is also known as the taciturn monastery because of the life 
           principals in the monastery based on the values of  simplicity, harmony with nature and keeping a vow of silence.</p>
        <p>The open views alongside Road no. 3 will accompany us until the Nachshon Junction. Here, we will
           start riding on the curving "Bravery Road" The name of the road links two junctions which are named after the two heroes Nachson and Shimshon.</p>
        <p>This part of the Road was paved during the War of Independence as a bypass to the road from Latrun to Sha'ar Hagai which was 
           controlled by the Jordan Legion and blocked the way to Jerusalem. From the Shimshon Junction, we will continue to Eshtaol and 
           Beit Shemesh from here we will start the significant climb for today. </p>
        <p>On road 3866 we will ride to Nes Harim and Bar Giora, and along the Sorek Ravine to Kerem Junction. Here, at the foot of the 
           Hadassah Hospital we will join all WOL riders for the last section of the Ride!  Hang in there â€“ the ALYN Hospital is just 
           "around the corner"! and the children of ALYN will be waiting for us!</p>
