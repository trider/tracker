        <p>Today we will ride almost from sea to sea. We will leave the beautiful town of Zichron Yaakov and begin riding eastwards, 
           until we reach the Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee). We start with a descent, riding towards road no. 70, which will soon change into a 
           climb to the Elyakim Junction. Here we will turn right for a 10 mile ride through the Ramot Menashe Park, known by some as the 
           “Tuscany of the Middle East". In 2011 UNESCO recognized the 20,000 acres of the Ramot Menashe district as a biosphere for reservation, 
           in order to maintain the natural and rural characteristics of this area.</p>
        <p>From Kibbutz Mishmar Ha'Emek we turn right again towards Megiddo Junction, passing the famous archeological site of Tel Megiddo. 
           Did you know that the word "Armageddon", described in the New Testament as the apocalypse derives from the Hebrew "Har Megiddo" meaning 
           "Mount of Megiddo"…?</p>
        <p>At the Megiddo Junction we will turn left on road 65, and ride on the well-known "Ruler Road", crossing the fertile fields of the Jezreel Valley and 
           ride through the town of Afula, the Capital of the Valley. We will enjoy the amazing view of Mt. Tabor rising 1300 ft. above the valley floor with 
           the Church of the Transfiguration lying at the top of the mountain.</p>
        <p>We will continue to Golani Junction. The museum commemorating the soldiers of the Golani Infantry Brigade is situated here. 
           From the Junction we will head down the 1,000 ft. steep decline towards Tiberias, enjoying the magnificent scenery of the 
           Sea of Galilee and the Golan Heights on the other side of the lake.</p>
